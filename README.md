# SoccerBetAnalyser
It is a python and Qlik Sense project.  Trough webscrapping using libs: requests, beautiful soup and xlsxwriter, I extract ifnromation about brazilian soccer games (Brasileir√£o Championship). And using Qlik Sense I transform and load this data into a dashboard to analyse if it is profitable to bet in how many goals a brazilian soccer team will make in a game.
